			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>[content, images, data for the home page]</p>
            <p>Examples below of content/images/data for the home page. Will try to possible make the actual recipes a drop down or take them to a new page when clicked on. Render them in javascript objects to then display.</p>
            <p>I plan to have 3 different recipes.</p>

            <h3>Header Details</h3>
            <h3>possible img:</h3>
            <p>"Recipe Share" text will be added to the center of the image.</p>
            <img src="circular-frame-with-healthy-food-empty-inside-picture-photo.jpg" alt="">

            <h3>First recipe example: Old Fashion Pancakes</h3>
            <img src="fluffy-pancakes-1664x832-1.jpg" alt="pancakes">
            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</p>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</p>
            <h3>Details</h3>
            <p>Can You Save Pancake Batter?
                Don't let leftover pancake batter go to waste! Store the batter in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two days. If you plan to keep it longer than that, it's best to freeze the batter.</p>



			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
            <p>Content for page two would be a form for those who might want to share a recipe. This will not immedietely add the recipe because I would need to be "reviewed" before added to the website. Or can be a form to make comments (use local storage and talk to Bro Thompson)</p>
            <p>(Header and header photo will be the same as the homepage.)</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				[Any additional details about home that the wireframe does not make
				clear]
			</p>
			<img src="#" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>
				[Any additional details about page 2 that the wireframe does not make
				clear]
			</p>
			<img src="#" alt="page 2 wireframe" />
