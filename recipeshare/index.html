            <h3>Can You Save Pancake Batter?</h3>
            <p>Don't let leftover pancake batter go to waste! Store the batter in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two days. If you plan to keep it longer than that, it's best to freeze the batter.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour </li>
                <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Directions:</h2>
            <ul class="directions">
                <ol>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</ol>
                <ol>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</ol>

            <h3>Can You Freeze Pancakes?</h3>
            <p>Allow the pancakes to cool completely, then arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet (make sure the edges aren't touching). Flash freeze for a few hours or up to overnight. Reheat in an oven set to 350 degrees F until warmed through.</p>
